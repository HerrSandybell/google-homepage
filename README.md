Hello everyone,

So this is my very first project. I decided to go with flex to position most elements. I learned quite a lot in this. However, I have to say that I have my doubts on whether flex was the best way to ensure the precision and accuracy that I would have needed to replicate google's homepage.

My biggest challenge was a weird horizontal white line between the footer and the bottom of the page. I got rid of it by enlaring the padding, despite the fact that I don't think I should have had to since it was placed at bottom:0px and position:absolute.

I'd love to know what could be improved.

All the best
